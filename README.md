# My personal website

This repository holds the Vapor project running my website, https://www.nicksetliff.com. The latest Master branch is what is currently deployed on my server.

This is my first project using a web framework to serve dynamic content. I went with Vapor as I'm already familiar with Swift and I've heard good things about it. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This project uses the Vapor framework, so you'll need a machine running Ubuntu or OS X with swift and vapor installed.

### Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickset/nicksetliff.git
cd nicksetliff
vapor build
```

If you're using OS X you can generate an Xcode project with
```bash
vapor xcode
```
